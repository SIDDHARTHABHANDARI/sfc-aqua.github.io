# For Students

## Joining AQUA (current SFC undergrads)

We welcome (almost) anyone to join AQUA at (almost) any time. (Credit toward graduation requires formally joining on a semester boundary!) If you are interested in joining us, please contact us. In the fall semester of 2023 we have meetings on Thursdays second and third period (1110-1430). Laboratory:[ΔN211](access.html) Please check the main [RG landing page](https://rg.sfc.keio.ac.jp/) or [Portal](https://portal.sfc.wide.ad.jp) (login required) for more information.

To receive credit toward graduation, students should register for the kenkyuukai (seminar) of Prof. Van Meter, Prof. Kusumoto, or any of the other RG faculty.

## Joining AQUA (prospective new graduate students)

Contacting Prof. Van Meter is both the right thing, and sometimes difficult. You may find it more reliable to contact one of the project faculty or current graduate students first. See the [Members page](members) for all contact information.

Prof. Van Meter has [a rather out-of-date](https://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~rdv/study.html) page on recommendations for planning to join AQUA as a graduate student. Read it first, but don't trust it all, and you will find that most of the links are busted.

## Quantum Classes

Quantum classes for undergraduates by Prof. Van Meter. Currently (2023) both are offered in the fall. In 2023, QIP is in Japanese for the first time, and Quantum Internet is offered in English -- as far as we are aware, the very first Quantum Internet course for undergraduates anywhere in the world! (Seeing complete syllabus will require a Keio login.)

- [Quantum Information Processing (量子情報処理)](https://syllabus.sfc.keio.ac.jp/courses/2023_35765?locale=en)
- [Quantum Internet](https://syllabus.sfc.keio.ac.jp/courses/2023_47917?locale=en)

For graduate students, Prof. Naoki Yamamoto, Center Chair of the Keio Quantum Computing Center, teaches valuable classes at the Yagami campus.

## Recommended Non-Quantum Classes

Brief descriptions of SFC classes can be found at [this website](https://syllabus.sfc.keio.ac.jp/?locale=en), but links are year-specific and seeing detailed syllabi requires a Keio login.

SFC undergrads should take the following data science (mathematics) and computing classes. Note that some of these are not offered in Japanese or in English each year, so plan accordingly. (\*) = programming background required.

- Linear Algebra (ideally as first-year undergrad (B1))
- Probability or Statistics (or both) (B1)
- Calculus (B1, B2)
- Optimization Theory (B2)
- Algorithm Science (B1, B2) (\*)
- Fundamentals of Logic (B1)
- Mathematics for Information Science (B1, B2)
- Introduction to the Internet (B1, B2)
- Digital Signal Processing Fundamentals (B2) (\*)
- Network Architecture (for those in the quantum communications sub-group) (B2)
- Operating Systems (B3) (\*)
- Computer Architecture (B3) (\*)
- Fundamentals of Analog and Digital Circuit (B2, B3)
- as many programming classes as possible, _in a sensible order to match your skill level_. There are a variety to choose from.
- security and cryptography classes as available

Graduate students should take the following:

- Design and Implementation of System Software
- Conceptual Framework (CI)
- Optical Networking (Prof. Tsuda, Yagami campus; not offered in 2023)

## Recommended Texts

For _much_ more on recommended books, see Prof. Van Meter's blog post, [A #QuantumNative Engineer's Bookshelf](https://rdvlivefromtokyo.blogspot.com/2020/05/a-quantumnative-engineers-bookshelf.html).

The group owns at least one copy of most of these books, and I'm happy to buy new books we think are valuable. (I'm much less happy about buying new copies of old books because we've lost them.)

## Other Topics

These four books will broaden and deepen your understanding of what it means to compute using physical systems, which of course is the only way computation is ever done.
